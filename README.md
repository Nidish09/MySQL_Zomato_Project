# MySQL_Zomato_Project

I have developed complex SQL queries to analyze customer behavior and transactions in a hypothetical Zomato-like platform. 

These queries extract valuable insights such as total spending per customer, visit frequency, initial purchases, popular items, and more. Additionally, I calculated Zomato points earned by customers based on their purchases and identified the most rewarding product. Furthermore, I determined the points earned during the first year of a customer's gold membership. 

Lastly, I ranked all transactions for customers, differentiating gold and non-gold member transactions. 

This project demonstrates strong SQL skills and the ability to derive actionable business insights from data, contributing to improved customer engagement and profitability.
